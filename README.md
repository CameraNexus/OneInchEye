# OneInchEye: OpenSource IMX283 Camera Board for Raspberry Pi

## Introduction
Welcome to the **OneInchEye** project, an open-source camera board designed for Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 boards using the IMX283 one-inch sensor. This project aims to provide a high-quality, affordable, and accessible camera module for advanced Raspberry Pi projects. The board is designed using KiCad v6, a popular open-source electronics design automation (EDA) software.

OneInchEye captures stunning high-resolution images and videos with improved low-light performance and dynamic range. It's perfect for photography enthusiasts, developers, and makers who want to level up their Raspberry Pi projects with a powerful camera. The board also features a TMP117 temperature sensor for accurate temperature readings.

**Please note that the OneInchEye is not compatible with most Raspberry Pi boards because it requires 22-pin FPC connector with 4-lane MIPI-CSI interface. Ensure compatibility with your specific board before proceeding.**

## Features
* 1-inch IMX283 sensor
* **Open-source hardware and software**
* Integrated TMP117 temperature sensor
* Compatible with Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 boards with a 22-pin FPC connector and 4-lane MIPI-CSI (same pinout as Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 IO Board)
